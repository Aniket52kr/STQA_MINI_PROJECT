Review: ✓ During winter when i put knob to 1 or 2, it started a loud noise tak-tak.✓ called service center also, but didn't resolve issue.✓ they sent technician, but he say, sound is from pipe breaking ice. So, think, during defrost, how can company say it is normal to make sound which is irritating.✓ though i hear sound coming from compressor. I want to claim under warranty but they say, since compressor is cooling fine. No need to change.✓ so i hve to bear this sound coz this is normal according to Whirlpool.✓ if u want to bear like me, then buy this.✓ it's barely 3 months and i want to sell away this.Whirlpool, shame on you for making this kind of sound making product
